Xpath:

How to identify the elements using xpath?

xpath is used to identify the elements on the DOM structire of the HTML page

DOM is called as Document Object Model.

DOM is used to visualize the pysical structure of the elemenyt on the webpage.

to start seeing the physical structure of an element we need do inspection of the html page.

in this xpath we should know the basic structure of the HTML page


<HTML>

	<head>

		<title>....<title>
	</head>

<body>

	// webelements

</body>


</HTML>


Here HTML is called as Root element.

Earlier days to identi any element on the DOM structure, people will take the refferece of the root elememt in order to identify an element



/html/body/div[6]/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/ul/li[1]/a

it is difficult to track the element
Time consuming process
poor in performance as it takes more time to identify an element on the page.


writting xpath in this fasjion is a bad pratice.

now to over come this xpath which is called as absolute xpath, is replaced with "Relative xpath"


so xpath is catorized in two ways

	* Absolute xpath(not a good way to identify)
	* Relative xpath(preffereable)


what is meant by relative xpath?

in the relative xpath we will try to identify exactly what element you want to work with.
in this relative xpath, we use the properties of the element given by the developer

properties are called as attributes.

syntax of writing simple relative xpath is:

//----- it indicates the xpath is relative xpath

//htmltag[@attribute,'value']

attributes might be 

id,name,class,or anything that waht a developer had given at the time of development

these attributes might be dynamic natutre.

once you identifuied an element ensure that , the properties that you used to identify an element is statiic


how can i know wheter the properties are dynamic or not?

execute the script every time launching a new browser instance.
if the script fail, check the property what it is having in the curent state, what is the property that is available while you design.

see what is changing, and we make moddification accordingly.

when ever we write an xpath it should be always a strong xpath.

To handle the dynamic properties of the element we have different types of relative xpath 

1.Function based xpath, all the function are java script based function
2.farwrd xpath--- identify the elements using the relationship
3.bacward xpath ---identify the elements using the relationship
4.logical xpath

all the above listed types will depend on the simple syantax of relative xpath only.

to write any type of relative xpath first we should knnow teh basic writting of the reative xpath.


HTML Tag:
<input type="text" data-val="true" data-val-required="First name is required." id="FirstName" name="FirstName">


<input---- htmltag

all other after the html tag is called as attributes or properties.


when there is an id, without any numerics in place and you dont have any unreadble text, use the id property.

id is used to identify aan element more uniquely.

//htmltag[@attribute='value']

//input[@id='FirstName']
