How to identify the webelements on the webpage?

WebElements are the elements developed by using HTML

CSS are used for the purpose of styling on the webpage

when the webdeveloper develop the application , he will will giving some properties to each element he/she developed.

these properties are called as attributes also.

using these attributes, in selenium there are 8 types of locators available

* id
* name
* xpath --- *****
* css --- ****
* tag name
* classname
* linktext
* partial linktext


in HTML there are two types of tags available

* paired html tags
* unpaired html tags

paired html tag: tags which have open and close tags we call it as paired html tags

for ex:

<a>.....</a>
<li>....</li>

unpaired html tags:

tag with only opening but no closing

<input />
<img />
<br />


learn what are the webcontrol available and what is their html tags available

1.button

opertion: click
validation: elememnt exist,enable, disable, check the name of the button
html tag: unpaired

<input type="button" value="buttonname"/>

<input----- html tag
type---- attribute or property

2.link

opeartion: click
validation: elememnt exist,check for link name, visited or non vistied, broken or not
html tag: paired

<a href="url">Register</a>

register is called as "InnerHTML" or "innerText"

when teh tag is <a>, in selenium we can identify the link by its innertext using the locator called "link text"

3.radio
operation: click
validation: elememnt exist,enable or disable, one option should selected, default select or not

htmltag: unpaired

<input type="radio">


4.textbox
operation: click,clear,enterdata
validation: elememnt exist,readonly,maxlength,get the value from the text

htmltag: unpaired

<input type="text">



5.checkboxbox
operation: click
validation: elememnt exist,check or uncheck

htmltag: unpaired

<input type="checkbox">




6.dropdown or select list
operation: select or deselect an option under the dropdown
validation: elememnt exist,dropdown is selected or not

htmltag: paired

<select>

	<option value="">option 1</option>
	<option value="">option 1</option>

</select>

in selenium to handle this dropdown, first we need to check wheter the html tag is select or not

if it is select as a htmltag, then we should use the class Select class.

steps to select a dropdown value :

1.Identify the slect tag for which element you want to select an option, store it a variable of type WebElement

Here you can call WebElement as a datatype or a class

Ex: WebElement dateOfBirth=driver.findElement(By.anylocator(""));


2.To select any value from a dropdown, we can use multiple ways

(a): select the option using a method called selectByVisibleText
(b): select option by using a method called selectByValue("give option attribute called value here")

(c): select option by using index ranking

by default the first optiontag will have index value as 0

select dropdown option by using selectByIndex(number)



How do i know wheter radiobutton and check box is selected?

There is a method available called as "isSelected"

this method can be applied only on radiobutton and checkboxes

this method will return true or false values

true when selected

false when the element is not selected
